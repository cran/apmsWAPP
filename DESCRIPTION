Description: apmsWAPP provides a complete workflow for the analysis of AP-MS data (replicate single-bait purifications including negative controls) based on spectral counts. 
		It comprises pre-processing, scoring and postprocessing of protein interactions.
		A final list of interaction candidates is reported: it provides a ranking of the candidates according 
		to their p-values which allow estimating the number of false-positive interactions.
